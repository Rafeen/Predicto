# predico
This is a machine learning approach for predicting the outcome of a EPL matches.

Dependencies:(needed to be pre installed)
python 3
scikit-learn
xgboost
pandas

you can install the missing packages by using pip install command

to run the code you need jupyter node book, you can install jupyter individually or can install ANACONDA which includes jupyter notebook along with other essential tools

The main project is inside of Football-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction folder, inside this folder there is 2 sub folders 
       datasets= contains the training and testing data
       Predictions=contains code for the predicting model
       
prediction contains the main codes of this project . 
cleaning and scraping contains the code for data scraping which makes the data collected from online applicable to the ML model 

predictions contains the main ML model that predicts the out come .

to run the code successfully you need to edit the paths of input csv files according to the location of the dataset folder in your computer. as python packages is strictly version dependent you need to confirm all the packages you pre installed is compatible 
.

the final step is to run the code ot jupyter notebook and you will get a visual representation of the stats and prediction for epl teams
